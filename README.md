## Finding trendiest topic in Machine Learning on NIPS Paper.
Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, I have analyzed a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. The techniques used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.
